          <h3>About Ghana</h3>
          <p>
            Ghana takes its name from the great medieval trading empire known as
            the Ghana Empire. It was founded by the Akan Ethnic group in the 13
            th century. The empire was rich in gold and traded widely with the
            Portuguese, Dutch, English, and others between the 15 th and 16 th
            centuries. This made it become known as the Gold Coast. The 17 th
            century saw a shift into the slave trade, with devastating effects
            on the country and huge implications for modern world history. Ghana
            was the first African country south of the Sahara to gain
            independence from the colonial rule of the British in 1957. Its
            revolution was led by the nationalist and Pan-Africanist Kwame
            Nkrumah, and the country has since become a model for African
            economic recovery and political reform. Ghana is well known for
            being among the world’s leading producers of high-quality sun-dried
            cocoa. Agriculture, forestry, and fishing employ more than half of
            the population. The country has a rich indigenous culture with
            people groups such as the Ewe, Fante, Nzema, and Ga Dambe, all with
            close ties to religion and institutions of chieftaincy. About 50
            indigenous languages are spoken in Ghana, the major ones being Akan,
            Ewe, Ga, Dagaare, and Dagbani. English is the official language.
            Harvest season, marriage, birth, puberty, and death call for various
            festivals and rites. These occasions are seen as an expression of
            anti-colonialism in the 21 st century.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The focus of this curriculum is on internships and international
            engineering concerns in Ghana and South Africa. Students will have
            the chance to learn about the nature of computer science and global
            engineering as well as acquire practical skills in computer science
            innovation and social entrepreneurship. The program will integrate
            Computer Science Principles and the Software Engineering Agile
            Methodology to allow students to build innovative technologies to
            address real world problems. Students will work for 6 weeks in Ghana
            with local entrepreneurs in sectors including healthcare, education,
            agriculture, and industry that heavily rely on artificial
            intelligence. In order to determine the demands of the clients,
            design a cutting-edge technological product, create a prototype, and
            demonstrate the solution, the students will collaborate directly
            with the clients. Students will gain proficiency in computer science
            as well as communication to non-technical audiences.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Students will also learn about Ghana through historical and cultural
            activities. They will learn to function and communicate successfully
            in multicultural situations, which is critical for their success
            throughout their internship and stay in Ghana. Students will return
            with not only professional skills, but also a greater understanding
            of another culture and an understanding of the function of
            engineering in a global, economic, environmental, and cultural
            context.
